These tools were made for bulk converting, checking, and unshortening URLs using **Google Sheets/App Script** and **Kutt** or **Bit.ly**. The journey started with Google, once upon a time when their link shortener existed--now that it does not, users may need to migrate away and unshorten those short links **before August, 2025**. It moved on to Bit.ly, once upon a time when their free tier was very generous. And it has finally reached Kutt, a self-hosted shortlink solution with an API. Good alternatives to Kutt are **Sink** (no API, single user), **Shlink** (API and import tools, single user), and **Snapp** (API and import tools).
